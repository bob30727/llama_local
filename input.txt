Hey! How are you today?
Do you know where the nearest bus stop is?
Let's go grab some coffee later.
No, I don’t want to go out today.
I'm sorry, I can't make it to the meeting.
It is 3 PM now.
I think this movie is great.
Do you like coffee?
Do you want this?
What time is it now?
Can you help me carry this bag?
I feel a little tired today.
Do you want to watch a movie tonight?

It's really hot outside.
Have you ever been to Japan?

What do you usually do on weekends?
I forgot my umbrella at home.
Do you know a good restaurant nearby?

What’s your favorite type of music?
Do you need any help with that?

I’m thinking about getting a new phone.
That was a really funny joke!
Would you like some tea?
I need to wake up early tomorrow.
Are you free this weekend?
The weather is so nice today.
What should we have for lunch?
I lost my keys again.
Let’s take a break for a while.
Have you seen my glasses?
I think I need a vacation.
That song is stuck in my head!
Can you hear me clearly?
This chair is really comfortable.
I love the smell of fresh coffee.
What are you planning to do today?
My phone battery is almost dead.
Do you want to join us for dinner?
I just saw a really cute dog.
Let’s go shopping this afternoon.
I can’t believe how fast time flies.

What’s the quickest way to finish this assignment?
May I add something to that point?
Sorry to cut in, but I have an update.
Hold on a second, let me explain.
Go ahead, I’ll wait for my turn.
Let’s take turns speaking.
Can I share my opinion on this?
I think we should let her finish first.
One at a time, please.
I’ll speak after you’re done.
Let’s make sure everyone gets a chance to talk.
What time does the meeting start?
Let’s set a deadline for this task.
How long do you think this will take?
I need to leave by 6 PM.
Can you remind me about our lunch tomorrow?
Let’s take a five-minute break.
We’re running out of time, let’s wrap up.
Can we postpone this to next week?
I have a tight schedule today.
Let’s meet at 10 AM sharp.
Speaking of movies, have you watched the latest Marvel film?
Before we move on, let’s summarize what we discussed.
That reminds me, I have something important to share.
Let’s change the topic and talk about work.
Just to clarify, are we meeting at the usual place?
By the way, did you hear the latest news?
On a different note, how’s your family doing?
Coming back to what we were discussing earlier...
Let’s conclude this and move on to the next point.
This brings me to my next question.
Let me rephrase that to make it clearer.
Sorry, I meant to say 5 PM, not 4 PM.
Actually, let me correct myself on that.
I think I explained that poorly—let me try again.
Wait, that’s not exactly what I meant.
I should have said it differently.
Let me clarify what I was trying to say.
I may have used the wrong word there.
What I meant was something slightly different.
That wasn’t the best way to say it, let me try again.
Could you slow down a little?
Can you repeat that more clearly?
Please speak louder, I can’t hear you well.
Can you simplify that explanation?
Could you rephrase that for me?
I didn’t catch that last part, can you repeat it?
Could you enunciate more clearly?
Please explain that again in a different way.
Can you give an example to make it clearer?
I didn’t quite understand, can you say it again?
Does that sound okay to you?
I hope I made that clear enough.
Let me know if you need me to clarify.
Am I making sense so far?
I think I got that right, but let me confirm.
I hope I’m explaining this properly.
Is this explanation working for you?
Let me check if I said that correctly.
I want to make sure I conveyed that correctly.
Did I explain that in an understandable way?
Did you mean that we should start earlier?
So, if I understand correctly, we need more time?
Are you saying that the plan has changed?
Let me confirm, you want me to handle this task?
Can you clarify what you just said?
So you’re suggesting we cancel the meeting?
Just to be sure, we’re meeting at 2 PM, right?
Are you saying we need to redo the entire project?
Let me repeat that to check if I understood correctly.
Does that mean we are going ahead with the new proposal?
Hi! How have you been?
I really appreciate your help.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you for taking the time to meet me.
It was great catching up with you!
Excuse me, could I ask for directions?
Have a nice day!
